                                College Students want to prioritize their health, but don't 
                                have the time, knowledge or motivation on how to do it.

                                Amazon wanted a marketing strategy for Amazon Prime Student. 
                                Our strategy team decided that we should create a gamified health 
                                platform, but wasn't clear on the details. I established the 
                                UX problem statement and created an “Amazon Health” website designed 
                                to make it easy and fun for college students to prioritize their health 
                                while engaging with Amazon Prime Student benefits.

                                For an Amazon Prime Student Case Competition, Amazon wants an Amazon 
                                Prime Student marketing plan targeted at Gen Z/current college freshman. 
                                After doing some research and establishing our course of action, our 
                                strategy team pivoted to a more competitive idea. Our strategy team 
                                proposed a single, centralized Amazon Health platform that, with the 
                                right features, would help Gen Z engage with Prime Student benefits. 
                                It'd also make Amazon a more palatable company to purchase from, as 
                                they'd be supporting student health. 
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                I (as the Design Lead and only UX Designer) had to create a mockup of 
                                the platform. While the strategy team had a rough idea of the features 
                                they wanted (a dashboard, some goals, and a leaderboard), they didn't 
                                have any of the specifics of the information they wanted to include, 
                                data they wanted to display, logistical details, etc. Thus, much of 
                                these details were left for me to explore. 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                
                        <div class="container-fluid" id="Interviews">
                            <h2 class="sticky-top position-md-static">Research: Interviews</h2>
                            <p>
                                At the current stage of the project, we had consumer research but no 
                                information on student's health prioritization or pain points. Since 
                                I was beginning consumer interviews with the primary research team, 
                                I proposed additional health questions to evaluate the solution's 
                                overall potential. Since we were forming our strategy in parallel, 
                                however, we were restricted in question specificity, since we didn't 
                                know what our health platform would entail.
                            </p>
                
                            <p>
                                The health questions investigated user's perceived importance of 
                                health and exercise, their current (time) investments into health 
                                and exercise, and any particular metrics/health aspects they were 
                                interested in. While many of the college freshmen wanted to prioritize 
                                health and exercise, many of them didn't have enough time to dedicate 
                                it. Users didn't have particular metrics they wanted to see; since 
                                they didn't have workouts or regular exercise sessions, they didn't 
                                know what should be measured.
                            </p>
                
                            <p>
                                From here, we found a problem our theoretical health platform could 
                                solve: College Students want to prioritize their health, but don't 
                                have the time or knowledge on how to do it.
                            </p>

                                For the UX process we had to create the whole UX in about two weeks, 
                                due to our recent pivot. Our new Amazon Health platform revolved 
                                around a centralized dashboard with some sort of health statistics, 
                                as well as emphasizing our three main areas of focus: physical health, 
                                mental health, and community health. The user data would be gathered 
                                from the Amazon Halo Band, i.e. an Amazon brand smart watch.
                            </p>
                
                            Prototype Goals and Lo-Fi Prototype
                            <p>
                                Our lo-fi prototype consisted of a rough mockup given by one of the 
                                members of the strategy team:
                                [Insert lo-fi prototype here]
                            </p>
                
                            To convert this to a hi-fi prototype, I wanted to emphasize a few of
                            important features from the original prototype goals:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Personalized experience, centered around an “Alexa” influencer 
                                    and/or a personalized player/profile picture
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    A fun and clean interface to encourage daily platform use and 
                                    engagement with health-related activities
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    An interesting way to engage and create an online Prime Student 
                                    community and leverage social networks to spur website adoption
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            [Convert to pdf?]
                            While Amazon provides a Prime Student style guide, I had a few 
                            overarching design themes to optimize it for college students:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Simple - the overall UX, while being very densely packed with 
                                    information, is intended to be simplistic to make it easy for 
                                    users to improve their health (with our website).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Central Alexa and user avatars - to engage users we wanted to 
                                    have a personalized avatar across many of the pages. Many of 
                                    the pages also include alexa in the top left corner, designed 
                                    to give users tips/encouragement and help users with navigational 
                                    issues if needed. Ideally, later prototypes would have interactive 
                                    animated avatars. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Circles and Waves/Liquid - Whether it's the point clusters or 
                                    quick goals, the frequent use of circles across the page is 
                                    designed to be soft on the user's eyes while still being visually 
                                    appealing. There are also “waves” of liquid representing 
                                    completeness on the quick goals; these were inspired by the 
                                    Aetna Health App, and I felt it was a visually intriguing but 
                                    calming way to easily see the goal completeness. 
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                The main dashboard page was designed to give a brief snapshot of the 
                                user's progress and to celebrate or encourage the user's current engagement 
                                levels. It features a central semi-circle that tracks the user's weekly 
                                health progress along (our) three dimensions: physical, mental, and 
                                community health. Each of these health aspects are tracked with a different 
                                metric (see weekly goals) and have an associated color, which stays

                                The main dashboard statistics were influenced by primary research/interviews; 
                                ince our interviewed college freshmen didn't know what metrics would be 
                                best, I chose simple measurements that were easy to quantify and compare,
                                like steps and time.

                                The “Quick Goals” page showcases challenges the user can complete within 
                                a limited amount of time to receive extra points. Since each bubble 
                                represents a goal, I designed the bubbles to expand as the time decreased, 
                                to further emphasize challenges that were about to expire (or “pop!”). 
                                Its background color also matches its respective health aspect. 
                            </p>

                                The page also features bubbles with the same “waves” to give the website 
                                a sense of cohesion. The goals also feature point multipliers for health 
                                categories that the user could spend more time practicing/emphasizing. 
                                For example, students who don't like to run (and often don't complete 
                                running goals) would be given bonus points for running goals. 
                            </p>

                                The “Weekly Goals” page measures the user's progress on our three aspects 
                                of health (physical, mental, community) based on a chosen metric each 
                                week. Users also receive bonus points for completing each weekly goal.
                            </p>

                                The “Community Goals” page is designed to start building a community of 
                                Prime Students through collaboration on a collective community goal that 
                                changes each month. Amazon would match donations based on community point 
                                totals. This allows Amazon to celebrate Gen Z's philanthropic desires 
                                while painting Amazon in a more desirable light.

                                The page also features select charities each month allowing Gen Z to 
                                learn about and/or support new causes.

                                The “Leaderboard” page allows users to compete with their friends to gain 
                                the most points and see their profiles. Each of the profiles includes 
                                the user's (selected) favorite exercises and an option to give points 
                                to each other (which was found in the user interviews to be an 
                                interesting/engaging feature). The leaderboard would create maintained interest
                                in the app and fuel users' motivation through competition.

                                The “Redeem Points” page is where users can redeem their points for 
                                prizes, incentivizing students to participate. These prizes would be related 
                                to Prime Student benefits, since the website is being pitched as a marketing 
                                tool for Amazon. These include things like “free 1 month Course Hero trial,” 
                                “$20 Amazon gift card,” “1 free article of clothing from Prime Wardrobe,” and more.

                                The “Profile” page allows users to designate their favorite exercises 
                                for their profile and see their overall health statistics. This includes 
                                a holistic Amazon Health Score (To easily gauge their progress), exercise 
                                and sleep levels, and comparisons with the users age group.

                                Being the sole UX designer and the design lead with only one other 
                                designer, all of the project design responsibility fell on my hands. 
                                Before our strategy pivot, my only responsibility was the case 
                                document design. However, we were now responsible for prototype 
                                mockups of our Amazon Health platform, with a loose framework provided 
                                by the strategy team. Thus, I took on the responsibility to convert 
                                these ideas into a prototype with only a month before the case was due.
                            </p>
                
                            <p>
                                With so little time to finish the design work for the case, I had to 
                                arrange how to fit in the rest of the design work within the next 
                                month between two people. We now had website UX deliverables in addition 
                                to the overall case design and implementation. Due to the tight 
                                timeline and unfinalized strategy, the design work had to happen in 
                                parallel with the strategy team's current deadlines.

                            <p>
                                To fit everything in on time, I created a rough timeline of all the 
                                tasks we needed to complete and divided them among our two designers 
                                based on our respective strengths. Since we were both full-time 
                                students, however, the deadlines had to be flexible and accommodate 
                                for the final exam season. The final schedule look like this:
                                [insert timeline here]

                            <p>
                                The design work helped solidify our overall case strategy by providing 
                                concrete visuals for the judges. The final case document has yet to be adjudicated.

                                This project taught me how to work with non-designers and turn their 
                                ideas into a full-fledged design. This meant understanding the core 
                                vision of the project and using their vision as a guideline to designing 
                                a website. To do this, I also had to find the core UX problem statement 
                                within their proposal. Since the strategy team simply wanted a 
                                “Health Website”, I had to find a relevant problem that the platform 
                                would be solving. Finally, I had to develop some project management 
                                skills by effectively dividing work among two people in order to 
                                finish the project on time.

                                If I had more time, it would be nice to actually go through the full 
                                design process and iterate through platform features, conduct usability 
                                tests, and possibly even try website implementation. With more people, 
                                I could also focus more on honing in on the problem statement with more 
                                in-depth interviews and more detailed idea generation. Though this 
                                project was slightly backwards (i.e. receiving the solution before the 
                                problem) due to the timeline, I think we still managed to discover 
                                and solve a relevant problem while simultaneously creating a product 
                                that satisfies the main case goals.
